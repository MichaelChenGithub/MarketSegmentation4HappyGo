# Market Segmentation Strategy for HappyGo
In this project, we provided marketing strategies for Happy Go through market segmentation. Through data exploration, we found that users on this platform exhibit diverse characteristics, encompassing both numerical and categorical features, providing valuable insights. Additionally, there is a significant gap between active and inactive users. To address this, we employed two clustering methods, Birch and K-prototypes, for segmenting Happy Go users. Finally, we used a decision tree and the visualization tool Tableau for user group profiling, enabling us to tailor marketing strategies for different audience segments.
